# An Analysis of MLB Pitch Selection

This project was completed for my undergraduate honors project in data science at St. Lawrence University. The work was completed throughout my senior year (2024-25) with 
help from my advisor Dr. Ivan Ramler. My research delves into clustering 2023 MLB starters based on general pitch selection and how they deviate from their usual arsenal under
different situations (2 outs, 2 strikes, etc.). The project contains several visualizations and models completed in both R and Python. The full paper can be found under 
`r_and_python.pdf`.
